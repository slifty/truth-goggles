Internet openness<br />Each Internet broadband provider can add to the benefits that the Internet delivers to Americans or it can threaten those benefits.<br />Internet providers have incentives to limit openness.<br />87% of Americans use the Internet, up from 14% in 1995.<br />Innovation is the chief driver of American economic growth, and innovation is at risk if openness is defeated.<br />The Appeals Court has twice shot down FCC rules; new rules must be adopted quickly.<br />The FCC proposes keeping the definitions and scope of rules from 2010, enhancing transparency so the public can monitor broadband practices that could undermine the open Internet, adopting rules to ensure robust dynamic Internet access, and requiring broadband providers to adhere to commercially reasonable and legally enforceable practices.</body></html>
