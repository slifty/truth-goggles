"For the verdict to be overturned, and justice to be recognized by Egypt. We must keep our voice loud to call for an end to their detention."<br />CNN correspondent Ian Lee, stationed outside the court in Cairo, said that through an appeals process, "there's a high likelihood that a judge could either reduce the sentence or acquit them later on."<br />(Because Al Jazeera has no staff operating in Egypt, CNN and other international broadcasters have been contributing reporting to its television coverage.)<br />Pawns in a geopolitical dispute<br />The prosecution, which has argued channels like Al Jazeera brought down Iraq and were planning to do the same in Egypt, has been widely condemned by international correspondents, press organizations and foreign governments.<br />Amnesty International has asserted that Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed are pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the tiny Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera. Qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood, a religious and political group banned in Egypt and labeled a terrorist organization after President Mohamed Morsy's ouster last year.</body></html>
